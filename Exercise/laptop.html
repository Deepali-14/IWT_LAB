		<p align=center><font size=4 color=white face="Calibri">A <u><b>laptop</b></u> is a small portable personal 
		computer consisting of a screen, an alphanumeric keyboard, and a touchpad. Sometimes, the laptop is also 
		called a notebook computer.<br><br>
		The first laptop was invented by Osborne Computer Corporation in April 1981 and its name was Osborne I. 
		At the time of release the cost of the Osborne I was $1795. Osborne I consists of 5 inches long screen,
	        64 KB of memory, and the keyboard which was on the lid of the computer. The weight of this first laptop is 
		about 25 pounds.<br><br>
		Laptops are used in every field such as research, education, Internet suffering, playing games, and homes.
		We can easily fold flat laptops for transportation. You can take laptops with you and use them in different 
		locations. Laptops have a battery which should be charged via sockets. As compared to desktop computers, 
		laptops are more expensive because they are more difficult to design.</font>
