		<p align=center><font size=4 color=white face="Calibri"><u><b>Coffee</b></u> is one of the world’s most popular beverages. Some claim it is the most widely consumed liquid in 
		the world aside from water.Coffee is more than a beverage, however.<br><br>It is a memory, an anticipation, a 
		lifetime of consoling moments of modest pleasure woven into our lives.Coffee’s success as a beverage 
		undoubtedly is owing both to the caffeine it harbors and to its sensory pleasure.<br><br> Coffee lovers come to 
		associate the energizing lift of the caffeine with the richness and aroma of the beverage that delivers it.
		Coffee is produced from the seeds of a small red (sometimes yellow) fruit that grows on plants halfway in 
		size between shrub and tree. The process that turns these seeds into beverage is a long and complex process, 
		perhaps the most complex process associated with any major beverage.</font></p>
