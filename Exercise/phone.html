		<p align=center><font size=4 color=white face="Calibri">A <u><b>mobile phone</b></u> is a wireless handheld device that 
		allows users to make and receive calls. While the earliest generation of mobile phones could only make and 
		receive calls, today’s mobile phones do a lot more, accommodating web browsers, games, cameras, video 
		players and navigational systems.<br><br>Also, while mobile phones used to be mainly known as “cell phones” or 
		cellular phones, today’s mobile phones are more commonly called “smartphones” because of all of the extra 
		voice and data services that they offer.</font>
