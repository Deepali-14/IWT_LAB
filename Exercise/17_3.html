            Uniform Resource Locator (URL)

            A client that wants to access a web page needs the file name and the address. To facilitate the access of documents 
            distributed throughout the world, HTTP uses locators. The uniform resource locator (URL) is a standard locator for 
            specifying any kind of information on the Internet. The URL defines four things: protocol, host computer, port, and path.  
            A URL has two main components: Protocol identifier: For the URL http://example.com, the protocol identifier is http. 
            Resource name: For the URL http://example.com, the resource name is example.com.
        </p>
        <p>
            The protocol is a client-server application program used to retrieve the document. Many different protocols can retrieve 
            a document; among them are Gopher, FTP, HTTP, News, and TELNET. The most common today is HTTP. The host is the domain name 
            of the computer on which the information is located. Web pages are usually stored in computers, and computers are given 
            domain name aliases that usually begin with the characters “www”. But the host can have any domain name. Thus, a URL is a 
            reference to a web resource specifying its location on a computer network and a mechanism to retrieve it.
