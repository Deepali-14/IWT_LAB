			<p>
				The <b>Internet is a global network</b> of billions of computers and other electronic devices. With the Internet, it's possible to access almost any information, communicate with anyone else in the world, and do much more.
				<br/>
				You can do all of this by connecting a computer to the Internet, which is also called <b>going online</b>. When someone says a computer is online, it's just another way of saying it's connected to the Internet.
