            Uniform Resource Locator (URL)

            A client that wants to access a Web page needs the file name and the address. To facilitate the access of documents distributed throughout the world, HTTP uses locators. The
            uniform resource locator (URL) is a standard locator for specifying any kind of information on the Internet. The URL defines four things: protocol, host computer, port, and
            path.
        </p>
        <p>
            The protocol is the client-server application program used to retrieve the document. Many different protocols can retrieve a document; among them are Gopher, FTP,
            HTTP, News, and TELNET. The most common today is HTTP. 
            The host is the domain name of the computer on which the information is located.
            Web pages are usually stored in computers, and computers are given domain name
            aliases that usually begin with the characters “www”. This is not mandatory, however,
            as the host can have any domain name.
